## FAQ

#### Hey, everybody in the world has an iPhone, why isn't this on the App Store yet?

I don't have an apple computer or an iphone which makes it difficult to put it on the App Store. I'm working it in (thanks to family members with an iphone), but idk when it will get there (sorry!)

#### Woah dude, why is the code so messy?

Hey! Its not messy! Well, not _super_ messy anyway. I tried to write neatly, comment often, and explain the code as I went, but since this was a independent project, I didn't really prioritize readable code (as long as it was readable to me!). I plan to go through and clean it up eventually though

#### I don't speak English (disregard the irony) and want to play this in [_insert language here_]. Will you do that?

I really do want to make a localization system, but that will take a ton of time to implement a system that translates all of my mortal text with their translations. It wasn't something I had in mind when I started the project and I need just need to do it! If anybody wants to help me with the actual translations, let me know!!
